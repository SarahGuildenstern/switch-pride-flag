  - Here, L refers to the length of the longer dimension and W refers to the shorter dimension.
- The 4 colored stripes are of equal width (W/4) and run the length of the flag.
  - The colors, starting from one edge, are ruby-grapefruit, slightly-reddish-orange, medium blue, and medium purple.
- The black and white regions are bound by a sine wave where the x-axis is the line between the orange and blue stripe
  - The amplitude is W/4
  - The period is L
  - There is no vertical shift or phase shift
  - The region bound by the wave and x-axis appearing on top of the orange stripe, is pure black
